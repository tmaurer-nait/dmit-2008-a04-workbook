# Next.js intro

# Steps

1. Install create-next-app
	`npm install -g create-next-app@latest`
2. Create a project with create-next-app
	`npx create-next-app@latest hello-next`
	This is going to take a while to build your project in the nested folder (hello-next)
4. Run the project
	Go in to the folder
	`cd hello-next`
	Run the project
	`npm run dev`
5. Change the title in the "pages/index.js" file in your "hello-next" project and see it change immediately on the page (this is hot module reload)
	- this is essentially the beginning to see what we're going to be building and how we're going to do it.
